Sunshine Ebook Generator
==================

This is my first attempt at creating a tool that uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to generate the HTML content for an [ePub 3](http://idpf.org/epub/30) ebook. I hope in the future to pack this CLI app as a GUI and to produce a complete ebook: the XML and XHTML files required for compliance along with the packaging algorythm (essentially the correct zip sequence)
